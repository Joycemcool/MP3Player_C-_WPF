### This project includes the following technical specs:
-   Test
•	WPF application using XAML and C#.
•	Use CommandBindings for the media and application controls
•	Use at least one User Control (Suggested use: Now Playing and/or Tag Editor screens)
•	Use at least three layout managers to create an intuitive and flexible user interface.
•	At minimum, the app should be able to read and write the following tag data: Song Title, Album, Year. Other tags can be used as desired.
•	Implement reasonable exception handling to avoid program crashes.
•	Note: The timer and progress slider shown in the screenshots are nice features to include, but optional.
